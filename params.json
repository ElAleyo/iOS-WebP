(_Not everyone has the luxury of a fast connection_)\r\n\r\nGoogle's WebP image format offers better compression compared to PNG or JPEG, allowing apps to send/retrieve images with smaller file sizes, reducing request times and hopefully providing a better user experience.\r\n\r\n![Demo Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/V4fBG1h.png)\r\n\r\n#Getting Started\r\n\r\n###The CocoaPods Way\r\n```ruby\r\npod 'iOS-WebP', '0.1'\r\n```\r\n\r\n###The Manual Way\r\nInclude the 3 files inside the `iOS-WebP` folder into your project:\r\n* `UIImage+WebP.h`\r\n* `UIImage+WebP.m`\r\n* `WebP.framework`\r\n\r\n#Usage\r\nDon't forget to `#import \"UIImage+WebP.h\"` or `#import <UIImage+WebP.h>` if you're using cocoapods.\r\nThere are 2 methods in `iOS-WebP`, converting images __to__ WebP format and converting images __from__ WebP format.\r\n```objective-c\r\n+ (UIImage *)imageFromWebP:(NSString *)filePath;\r\n+ (NSData *)imageToWebP:(UIImage *)image quality:(CGFloat)quality;\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing the methods are pretty easy:\r\n\r\n```objective-c\r\n//Converting To WebP\r\nNSData *webpData = [UIImage imageToWebP:[UIImage imageNamed:@\"image.jpg\"] quality:75];\r\n\r\n//Converting From WebP\r\nUIImage *webPImage = [UIImage imageFromWebP:@\"/path/to/file\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nCredit\r\n========\r\nBased off [WebP-iOS-example](https://github.com/carsonmcdonald/WebP-iOS-example \"WebP-iOS-example\") by Carson McDonald\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
